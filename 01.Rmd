## A beginning.

Pharmaceutical drugs are a cornerstone of modern medicine.
They are important treatments for many infectious diseases, psychiatric disorders, cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, autoimmune diseases, and more.
The problem is the enormous cost of research and development in new drugs, which has gotten worse in the 21st century.
In 2014, it was reported to cost about $2.6 billion to get a new drug on the marketâ€”double the cost from 10 years ago (145% increase when adjusted for inflation). [@drug-cost]
Only about 1 in 10 drugs to enter clinical trials ever get approved. [@drug-approval]
These costs are incurred during the clinical trials, where drugs are vetted for efficacy and safety in humans, and during pre-clinical research, where the drug's structure and function are optimized in order to pass clinical trials.
One of the most widely used design principles during this optimization process is [Lipinski's Rule of Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipinski%27s_rule_of_five)
In following these award-winning rules, chemists increase their chances of producing drug candidates with favorable [pharmacokinetic properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics)
This helps reduce the "chemical space," or the set of possible molecules that need to be explored as potential candiates, reducing the number of experiments needed and the costs in turn.
This rule was formulated in 1997.
In the past 20 years, new innovations in computing power and machine learning have come forth that provide promising avenues for finding new, more complex rules.
Machine learning models can be trained to classify favorable pharmacophores with higher fidelity by leveraging lots of existing data on drugs and drug candidates.
Such a tool can further aid the preclinical research and reduce costs.
Additionally, more highly optimized candidates might be identified, increasing the likelihood of FDA approval.

## A middle.

Machine learning models can learn complex, non-linear trends in order to classify numerical inputs.
The goal is to classify potential drug candidates as having favorable or unfavorable pharmacokinetics.
Existing data will be used on drugs and drug candidates to train various types of models to predict pharmacokinetic favorableness, or "drug-likeness".
Models to evaluate include logistic classifiers, random forests (decision trees), and neural networks.
These models require numerical data as input. Molecules are not easily represented as vectors, as they comprise graph of bonds between different non-ordinal atomic identities in distinct 3D structures.
Some methods will also be explored to approximate or capture specific molecular features as matrices.

### Structural Matrix

An organic molecule's carbon skeleton is often the primary influence for its 3D shape.
We can represent a carbon chain by placing the carbons as rows and columns in a matrix, $A$ and having the bond order between carbon $i$ and $j$ occupy the cell in $A_{i,j}$

For example, cholestorol would have the following bond matrix:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\

### Functional Group Vector

Another possible numerical representation could be the [functional groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group) present in the molecule.
By assigning various indeces to function groups of interest, (e.g. 1 = carboxylic acid, 2 = ketone, 3 = aromatic ring, etc) a vector of the number of occurences of each functional group can be constructed.

### Other Possible Representations

Things like the electrical dipoles, locations of electron pairs, and other molecular features could be encoded as matrices.

Another possible representation is the dipoles.

## An end.

By exploring the various ways to encode molecules as vectors and matrices, they became eligible as inputs for machine learning.
Several representations including structural, dipolar, and functional information enabled classifiers to select good candidates for drug optimization.
These models can enable medicinal chemisty researchers to more judiciously choose which analogs to synthesize and test for drug efficacy.
Such insights reduce the number of experiments that have to be conducted, bring down costs, and increase the likelihood of clinical trial success.
There remains some error in the predications, as there are complexities not captured by the input.
The actual 3D conformations, affinity for metabolic proteins, the molecular orbitals and their energy levels were not adequately represented.
